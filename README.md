# WL-Sense-Analytics-ThingChart
In this project we are publishing the wireless Vibration and Temperature sensor data to Thing Speak using ThingSpeak MQTT API.
We have also made an interactive webpage using html,CSS,BootStrap and Javascript function where we can visualize different sensor data using Google Charts.
In our firmware we are loading this webpage from SPIFFS and streaming it on local WiFi IP. We can see it by opening local WiFi IP in web browser.

* First of all open the local WiFi IP in your Webbrowser.
* Second step is to Select the sensor as an example here we have selected Temperature and Humidity Sensor.
* In the third Step select the Event to e triggered we are using IFTTT for email notification and messages

* Similarly we can do it for Wireless Vibration and Temperature Sensors. There is one column in graph which will show the temperature and     Vibration values.
